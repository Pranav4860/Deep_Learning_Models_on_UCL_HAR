## UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Project

This project involved building both classical machine learning and deep learning models on the UCI-HAR dataset.

- [Deep Learning Models (LSTM, 1D CNN)]([https://github.com/Pranav4860/Deep_Learning_Models_on_UCL_HAR]))
- [ML Models using TSFEL (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)]([https://github.com/Aryan-IIT/es335-24-fall-assignment-1]))
